<h2>Background</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
  <p> Sleep is a widely conserved feature across animal species, imperative for life. Many studies have highlighted the importance of sleep, for example by investigating the effect of sleep amount on survival <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref1" >[1][2]</a>, but the regulation of sleep is poorly understood. Equally, the function of sleep is not explicitly defined, although it is intuitively established to have a restorative effect. </p>
<p>In spite of being poorly understood phenomenon, sleep timing
is believed to be tightly regulated by two primary interacting processes: circadian rhythm and <dfn data-info="Tendency of animals to auto-regulate and maintain their internal environment in a stable state, in this context referring to sleep. This also involves build-up of sleep pressure with increased wakefulness">homeostatic process</dfn> <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref3" >[3]</a> . Although extensive research into circadian rhythms has been conducted, relatively little is known about the homeostatic part of sleep regulation. Moreover, sleep-wake cycles are also influenced by hundreds of environmental and genetic interactions <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref4" >[4]</a>. To reduce some of this complexity, Drosophila melanogaster flie used as a model organism to understand mechanisms that underlie sleep and translate these findings to human sleep.  </p>
  <p> Drosophila flies have been used extensively in sleep research; both to further understanding of sleep and to act as a model of human sleep <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref5" >[5]</a>. They share homologous sleep features with humans, such as a stable <dfn data-info="a biological process that displays an inherent recurrent behaviour every 24 hours">circadian</dfn> sleep rhythm (see Fig.1) and experiencing longer episodes of rebound after sleep deprivation <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref6" >[6]</a>. Moreover, flies have similar responses to stimulant substances that would typically affect human sleep, such as caffeine and cocaine <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref7" >[7][8]</a>. Using Drosophila enables monitoring over a longer period (>4 days) than in mammalian sleep duration studies (typically 1 day) <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref9" >[9]</a> and allows for a greater number of transitions available for
  statistical analysis than mammalian sleep studies can offer, making <i>Drosophila</i> flies an advantageous model organism for human sleep.</p>

<br>
<p>As members of a <dfn data-info="Characterises behaviour of animals that are active in the daytime.">diurnal</dfn> species, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> flies experience sleep as a series of discrete <dfn data-info="A period of exhibiting certain behaviour.">bouts</dfn> interrupted by bouts of wakefulness. These bouts are consolidated at night but have a more fragmented structure throughout daytime <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref10" >[10]</a>. </p>
          <p> Because the precise nature of these distributions critically shapes the models adopted to describe temporal dynamics of sleep, establishing statistical properties of these bout durations is important. New information that emerges can help shape models of sleep behaviour and point to potential neural processes responsible for it. </p>




<br>
<br>
<h2> Distributional analysis </h2>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px;"> Studying distribution of sleep bouts allows to learn more about sleep dynamics and its underlying generating mechanism. This is achieved by trying to find the most appropriate mathematical functional forms or <dfn data-info="Based on a mathematical function whose shape and range is determined by one or more distribution parameters, parameter set is fixed">parametric distributions</dfn> to describe the distributions. While complex functional forms can be derived, they prove difficult at the time of interpretation of how they relate to biological systems. There are 4 main classes of simple functional forms which have biologically interpretable underlying mechanisms and are commonly used in study of complex systems. These are the <a class="mylink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function" target="_blank">exponential function</a>, the stretched exponential (<a class="mylink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution" target="_blank">Weibull</a>), the <a class="mylink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law" target="_blank">power law</a> and the <a class="mylink"
   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution" target="_blank">log-normal distribution.</a> <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref11" >[11]</a> <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref11" >[12]</a>

  <h4>Exponential</h4>
    <p> The exponential function is observed when the intervals form a memoryless process with a constant hazard rate <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref13" >[13]</a> . The <mark> probability density function (PDF) </mark> of an exponential  distribution is:</p>
    <img style="text-align:center;" src="img/exponential.svg" ></img>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> where  λ > 0 is the parameter of the distribution, often called the <mark>rate parameter</mark>.  </p>
    <p> If the bouts are exponentially distributed, this means that there is a memoryless process involved. In the context of sleep, this means that the probability of waking up from sleep is not dependent on duration of the sleep bout. Previous studies have reported sleep bouts to be exponentially distributed in humans, however, the validity of these results has been questioned given the obvious nonstationarity of the <dfn data-info="Graph representing the stages of sleep as a function of time"> hypnograms </dfn> <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref14" >[14]</a>.</p>




  <h4>Weibull</h4>
    <p>The stretched exponential function and its corresponding Weibull distribution are generalizations of the exponential function, where a shape parameter is introduced as a power of time. This means that the probability of observing an event is dependant on the time passed since the previous event. Because of this, Weibull is a favoured distribution for duration models, which imply duration-dependent probabilities <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref15" >[15]</a>. The probability density function of a Weibull distribution is:</p>
    <img style="text-align:center;" src="img/weibull.svg" ></img>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> where  k > 0 is the <mark>shape parameter</mark>and λ > 0 is the <mark>scale parameter</mark> of the distribution. </p>


<h4> Power law</h4>
<p> Power law distributions are thought to arise from multiple interacting components of a complex system <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref16" >[16]</a>. The observations of such systems often follow a similar pattern across multiple measurement scales (sometimes referred to as "scale-free") . Fitting power law distributions should be critically analysed due to a power-law fitting problem: other distribution functions can falsely or only partially appear to follow power-law, for example lognormal distribution can be mistaken for power law and a sufficiently big dataset is necessary to confidently distinguish between them <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref17" >[17]</a>. The PDF for the power law distribution is:</p>
<img style="text-align:center;" src="img/pareto.svg" ></img>




<br>
<br>

<h4> Log-normal distribution </h4>
<p> Log-normal distribution is observed when a large number of independent components' interactions create a multiplicative effect, which also gives rise to a heavy-tailed distribution <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref18" >[18]</a>. The PDF of a log-normal distribution is given below:</p>
<img style="text-align:center;" src="img/lognormal.png" width="380" height="40" ></img>

</figure>
<br>
<h2> Survival analysis </h2>
<p>Survival data are generally described and modelled in terms of two related probabilities, survival and hazard. The survival probability (also called the survivor function S(t)) is the probability that an individual survives from the time origin to a specified event at time t. These values are important for directly describing the survival experience of a study population. </p>
<img src="img/survival.png" width = 300 height = 55></img><p font-size:5px;> <i>T denotes a response variable </i></p> <br>

<p>The hazard is usually denoted by <i>h(t)</i> and is the probability that an individual under observation at a time t has an event at that time, in other words, the instantaneous event rate for an individual who has already survived to time t. While the survivor function focuses more on not having an event (cumulative non-occurrence), the hazard function focuses on the rate of event incidence. It is of particular interest because it provides insight into the conditional failure rates of the process and provides a basis for specifying a survival model <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref19" >[19]</a>. </p><img src="img/hazard.png" width = 500 height = 90></img>

<p> A beginning and end of a sleep episode can be thought of as its 'birth' and 'death', enabling to perform survival analysis with bout data. This probabilistic method is based on the concept that a state (sleep or wakefulness) "survives" until its transition into another state <a class="mylink" href="references.html">[20]</a>. This method is also used to determine if the rate of transition into another state are similar at all bout durations, or if the transition rate for short bouts differs to that of long bouts. Survival-based analysis allows for the quantification of the relative distribution of bout lengths and can provide information about the underlying physiology involed in initiating, maintating and terminating each sleep state. Studies of this kind have been successful in describing sleep microarchitecture in mice <a class="mylink" href="references.html">[21]</a>. </p>

<h2> Previous studies<h2>
  <p> Several studies in mammals have employed mathematical and statistical methods to investigate the distribution of sleep bout durations obtained from <dfn data-info= "Technique to monitor electrical activity of the brain">electroencephalography (EEG)</dfn> and <dfn data-info="techinique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles." >electromyography (EMG)</dfn> readings <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref22" >[22]</a> <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref23" >[23]</a> <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref24" >[24]</a>.  Their findings indicate that sleep bout durations follow an exponential distribution across mice, cats, and humans with the scale parameter increasing with body size and evident deviations from the
  exponential distribution have been observed in the tail.  It has been widely recognised that there is a high degree of apparent random variability in sleep-wake architecture in rodents, other mammals, and most recently, flies <a class="mylink" href="references.html#ref14" >[14]</a>.
   </p>

 					<p style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 140%">
 In a very open scope of the project, I chose 4 aforementioned distributions for parametric fitting on the basis of their potential biological context when applied to sleep. The key premise is that the distribution's shape reveals information about the governing dynamics of the systems that gave rise to the distribution. Additional survival-based analysis was performed to investigate the influence of covariates in a parametric regression survival model.
